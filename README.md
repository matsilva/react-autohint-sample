# react-autohint-sample

##The Challenge
Create an auto hints to a search input using the following API endpoint: `http://mock-autocomplete.herokuapp.com/autocomplete?q=v`

###Bonus points
* Allow the user to select from a drop down list using the up and down arrows
* If a user types really fast, prevent ajax requests from firing until the user has finished typing fast.
* Optimize endpoint requests, in particular we only want the latest request to succeed.
